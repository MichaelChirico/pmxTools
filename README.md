Pharmacometric Tools for Modeling &amp; Simulation

Pharmacometric tools for common data analytical tasks; closed-form solutions for calculating concentrations at given 
    times after dosing based on compartmental PK models (1-compartment, 2-compartment and 3-compartment, covering infusions, zero- 
    and first-order absorption, and lag times, after single doses and at steady state, per Bertrand & Mentre (2008) 
    <http://lixoft.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/PKPDlibrary.pdf>); parametric simulation from NONMEM-generated parameter estimates 
    and other output; and parsing, tabulating and plotting results generated by Perl-speaks-NONMEM (PsN).
